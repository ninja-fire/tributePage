            In 2013, a building in the capital of Bangladesh, <b>The Rana Plaza</b>
            in Dhaka, collapsed on textile design workshops, causing <b>several thousand injuries</b>
            and around 1,135 deaths. The causes are simple: the eight-story building was in dire need of renovation, but
            the contractors (brands) and managers on site did not take into account the severity of the cracks and
            fragility of the building. In the rubble, labels of the brands Carrefour, Auchan, Camaïeu were found and
            Mango, Benetton or even Primark were known to place orders with these manufacturers. This story, which has
            caused a lot of noise and which is now a benchmark event in fashion, has above all made it possible to
            highlight practices known as <b>“fast fashion”</b> causing serious ecological and social damage.

          <p>Following this Rana Plaza incident, far from an isolated case, <b class="keyword">Carry Somers</b> and <b
              class="keyword">Orsola de
            Castro</b>, two
            British
            designers, decided to create the <b>Fashion Revolution</b>. The aim is to create a movement of action for
            the
            fashion
            industry by making it more <b>transparent</b> and less harmful to the environment and to textile workers.
            The
            Fashion
            Revolution is present in around <b>100 countries</b> and you can follow the actions implemented in your
            country on
            social networks (one Instagram account exists per country). <b>Fashion Revolution day</b>, celebrated on
            April 24,
            marks
            the anniversary of the Rana Plaza event and brought out the hashtag #whomademyclothes, which was first
            featured
            on twitter in 2015 when it launched. Fashion Revolution Day was transformed in 2016 into <b>Fashion
              Revolution
              Week</b>
            which always takes place in April in <b>90 countries</b> and brings together tens of thousands of people
            around the
            issue of fast fashion.</p>

          <p><b>Your voice can change everything.</b>

            Since Fashion Revolution started, people from all over the world have used their voice and their power to
            tell brands that <b>things must change</b>. And it’s working. The industry is starting to change.
            <b>More</b> brands are
            being open about where their clothes are made. <b>More</b> manufacturers are making their factories safer.
            <b>More</b>
            producers are being seen and heard.

            But the story is far from over. We are only just getting started. We can’t stop until <b>every garment
              worker</b>
            who makes the clothes we love is seen, heard, paid properly and working in safe conditions. Your voice does
            make a difference. We need to make this Fashion Revolution Week bigger and bolder than ever before. <b>Ask
              brands #whomademyclothes?</b></p>
